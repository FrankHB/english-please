**This is an offer to repositories that are written a Chinese language.**

Basicly this script checks the trend repos and it will open a issue to the chinese language repos about the English translation.

We want to say just one thing:


### Our Problem about Chinese README

Firstly we congratulate you for getting so much star by sharing this repository with humanity.

We're always disappointing when we couldn't understand a trending repository and we think we are not alone about that. When we see this article, our minds are blurring like that Gollum.

**Maybe** you will want to help us,

### What we want:
 - Add English translation to sharing knowledge to more people.

### What our promise:
 - More feedback to improve project.
 - New ideas about your project.
 - Great fame.
